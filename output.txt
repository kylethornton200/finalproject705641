Based on the provided context, the claim "Conservatives are downright furious after Saturday Night Live's Michael Che cracked a joke likening tangerine sh*tgibbon Donald Trump to a monkey with a machine gun. No, they're not mad because an insult was leveled at Trump (this time) — they're furious that they don't get to apply the term to black people (specifically Obama) without facing criticism" appears **incorrect**.

The context does not provide evidence of similar comparisons made by Democrats or liberals during George W. Bush's presidency, nor does it suggest that such comparisons were deemed racist and resulted in job loss or public shaming for those making them. The article from Gateway Pundit is cited as an example of conservative outrage, but its claims are not supported by the provided context.

The proposed litmus test would ask immigrants about their support for American values, including gender equality and gay rights. However, the sources do not mention that the Trump Administration would deny entry to immigrants who answer "no" to these questions. In fact, the Congressional Research Service report on India's religious freedom issues highlights the importance of respecting diverse religious beliefs and practices, suggesting that a test based on support for religious freedom might be problematic.

McConnell's statement is contradicted by CRS Report RL31980, Senate Consideration of Presidential Nominations: Committee and Floor Procedure, which states that "any Senator who voted with the majority on the nomination has the option of moving to reconsider a vote" (Source: CRS Report RL31980, under subheading "Consideration and Disposition").

The claim that Trump caused a diplomatic crisis with China because he wanted to build a resort in Taiwan is not supported by any evidence. In fact, the context suggests that there was no such phone call between Trump and Tsai Ing-wen, the president of Taiwan. According to the sources, the US has maintained a one-China policy since 1979, and no president or president-elect has spoken with the country's president since then.

The article does mention that the Trump Organization is considering investing in Taiwan, but this is not related to a phone call between Trump and Tsai Ing-wen. The mayor of Taoyuan confirmed rumors about the Trump Organization's interest in building luxury hotels and resorts in the city, but there is no evidence to suggest that this was motivated by a desire to build a resort specifically for President-elect Trump or his family.

The article discusses how Barack Obama's inner circle is desperately fighting to protect his reputation by speaking out against President Donald Trump's foreign policy. The author argues that Obama's administration was ineffective and dangerous in its approach to international relations, and that Trump's policies are a significant improvement.

The article highlights several examples of Obama's failed foreign policy, including:

1. Outourcing the resolution of the Syrian conflict to Moscow in 2013, which allowed Vladimir Putin to intervene militarily in Syria.
2. Scrapping George W. Bush-era agreements to move radar and missile interceptor installations to Central Europe, which weakened NATO's presence in the region.
3. Ending America's armored combat units' footprint on the Continent, leaving only two U.S. Army brigades stationed in Europe by 2014.
4. Failing to condemn Putin's brazen intervention in the 2016 election until the final month of Obama's presidency.

In contrast, Trump's administration has taken a tougher stance on Russia, imposing harsh sanctions and conducting airstrikes against Putin's vassal regime in Syria. The article also notes that Trump has expanded U.S. arms sales to Ukraine, which is a significant blow to Putin's ambitions in Europe.

The author argues that Obama's inner circle is angry because they are unable to defend their own failed policies, and that they are resorting to personal attacks on Trump instead of addressing the substance of his foreign policy. The article concludes that Trump's record on Russia is stronger than Obama's, and that the Obama administration's reputation is at risk due to its failures in international relations.

Overall, the article presents a critical view of Obama's foreign policy and argues that Trump's policies are a significant improvement. However, it also raises questions about the motivations behind Obama's inner circle's attacks on Trump and whether they are genuinely concerned about his policies or simply trying to protect their own reputations.

The claim that ZANU-PF will "never succumb" to army threats is contradicted by historical evidence. In November 2017, the military intervened in a coup against President Robert Mugabe, who had been in power for nearly four decades. The statement by Chiwenga, which was described as "treasonable conduct," suggests that the military was willing to take action to end a purge within the party. This event demonstrates that ZANU-PF has indeed succumbed to army threats in the past.

The claim is that President Trump announced he would not attend the 2017 White House Correspondents Dinner, but instead held a rally in Pennsylvania, forcing the media to play defense. However, according to the context block, there is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, the sources mention that President Trump did attend the 2017 White House Correspondents Dinner and delivered a speech, which was met with laughter and criticism from some attendees.

The quote from Seth Meyers' speech at the dinner also contradicts the claim, as it mentions that Trump "pummel[ed] himself" with jokes, suggesting that he took part in the event.

Based on the sources above, this claim appears **incorrect**. The Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) established that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry, and no state can deny them this right without violating federal law.

In fact, the Alabama Senate Bill 143 passed by the state senate is actually an attempt to undermine this ruling and protect Christian rights, as stated by Senator Greg Albritton. However, the bill's provisions would still require minors to obtain parental permission for marriage and prevent the state from recording a marriage contract if either party is already married or related by blood or adoption.

The Supreme Court has consistently upheld the right to same-sex marriage, and it is unlikely that any state can pass legislation that effectively nullifies this right without facing significant legal challenges.
